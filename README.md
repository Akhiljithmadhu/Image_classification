Project Title: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification

Project Overview:
In this project, we aim to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification. CNNs are particularly powerful in image-related tasks due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical patterns from the data. Image classification involves categorizing images into predefined classes or categories based on their visual features. This project will involve training a CNN on a dataset of labeled images to accurately classify new, unseen images into their respective categories.

Dataset:
The success of any machine learning project heavily relies on the quality and quantity of the dataset. For this project, we will utilize a dataset containing a large number of labeled images across different classes. The dataset will be divided into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring that the model is trained on diverse data and evaluated rigorously.
